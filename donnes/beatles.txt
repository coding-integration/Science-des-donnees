the
world
spinning
round
well

you

me
understand
cos
ive
been
in
love
before
and
i
found
that
love
was
more
than
just
holding
hands
if
i
give
my
heart
to
you
i
must
be
sure
from
the
very
start
that
you
would
love
me
more
than
her
if
i
trust
in
you

dont
run
and
hide
if
i
love
you
too
oh
please
dont
hurt
my
pride
like
her
cos
i
couldnt
stand
the
pain
and
i
would
be
sad
if
our
new
love
was
in
vain
so
i
hope
you
see
that
i
would
love
to
love
you
and
that
she
will
cry
when
she
learns
we
are
two
cos
i
couldnt
stand
the
pain
and
i

hope
you
see
that
i
would
love
to
love
you

that
she
will
cry

a

ran
off
with
another

himself
a

rocky
raccoon
checked
into
his
room
only
to

gideons
bible
rocky
had
come
equipped
with
a
gun
to
shoot
off
the
legs
of
his
rival
his
rival
it

broken
his

name
was
magill
and
she
called
herself
lill

she
and
her
man
who
called
himself

were
in
the
next
room
at
the
hoe
down
rocky
bust
in
and
grinning
a
grin

daniel
was
hot
ndash
he
drew
first
and
shot

rocky
collapsed
in
the
corner
now
the
doctor
came
in
stinking
of
gin
and
proceeded
to
lie
on
the
table
he
said
rocky

we
were
talking
about
the
space
between
us
all
and
the
people
who
hide
themselves
behind
a
wall
of
illusion
never
glimpse
the
truth
then
itrsquos
far
too
late
when
they
pass
away
we
were
talking
about
the
love
we
all
could
share
when
we
find
it
to
try
our
best
to
hold
it
there
with
our
love
with
our
love
we
could
save
the
world
if
they
only
knew
try
to
realize
its
all
within
yourself
noone
else
can
make
you
change
and
to
see
youre
really
only
very
small
and
life
flows
on
within
you
and
without
you
we
were
talking
about
the
love
thats
gone
so
cold
and
the
people
who
gain
the
world
and
lose
their
soul
they
dont
know
they
cant
see
are
you
one
of
them
when
youve
seen
beyond
yourself
then
you
may
find
peace
of
mind
is
waiting
there
and
the
time
will
come
when
you
see
were
all
one
and
life
flows
on
within
you
and
without
you
say
the
word
and
youll
be
free
say
the
word
and
be
like
